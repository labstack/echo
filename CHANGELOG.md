# Changelog

## v4.5.0 - 2021-08-01

**Important notes**

A **BREAKING CHANGE** is introduced for JWT middleware users.
The JWT library used for the JWT middleware had to be changed from [github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) to
[github.com/golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) due former library being unmaintained and affected by security
issues.
The [github.com/golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) project is a drop-in replacement, but supports only the latest 2 Go versions.
So for JWT middleware users Go 1.15+ is required. For detailed information please read [#1940](https://github.com/labstack/echo/discussions/)

To change the library imports in all .go files in your project replace all occurrences of `dgrijalva/jwt-go` with `golang-jwt/jwt`.

For Linux CLI you can use:
```bash
find -type f -name "*.go" -exec sed -i "s/dgrijalva\/jwt-go/golang-jwt\/jwt/g" {} \;
go mod tidy
```

**Fixes**

* Change JWT library to `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt` [#1946](https://github.com/labstack/echo/pull/1946)

## v4.3.0 - 2021-05-08

**Important notes**

* Route matching has improvements for following cases:
  1. Correctly match routes with parameter part as last part of route (with trailing backslash)
  2. Considering handlers when resolving routes and search for matching http method handler
* Echo minimal Go version is now 1.13. 

**Fixes**

* When url ends with slash first param route is the match [#1804](https://github.com/labstack/echo/pull/1812)
* Router should check if node is suitable as matching route by path+method and if not then continue search in tree [#1808](https://github.com/labstack/echo/issues/1808)

## v4.2.2 - 2021-04-07

**Fixes**

* Allow proxy middleware to use query part in rewrite (#1802)
* Fix timeout middleware not sending status code when handler returns an error (#1805)
* Fix Bind() when target is array/slice and path/query params complains bind target not being struct (#1835)

* Fix timeout middleware docs (#1836)

## v4.2.1 - 2021-03-08

**Important notes**

Due to a datarace the config parameters for the newly added timeout middleware required a change.
See the [docs](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/timeout).
A performance regression has been fixed, even bringing better performance than before for some routing scenarios.

**Fixes**

* Fix performance regression caused by path escaping (#1777, #1798, #1799, aldas)
* Avoid context canceled errors (#1789, clwluvw)
* Improve router to use on stack backtracking (#1791, aldas, stffabi)
* Fix panic in timeout middleware not being not recovered and cause application crash (#1794, aldas)
* Fix Echo.Serve() not serving on HTTP port correctly when TLSListener is used (#1785, #1793, aldas)
* Apply go fmt (#1788, Le0tk0k)
* Uses strings.Equalfold (#1790, rkilingr)
* Improve code quality (#1792, withshubh)

## v4.2.0 - 2021-02-11

**Important notes**

The behaviour for binding data has been reworked for compatibility with echo before v4.1.11 by
enforcing `explicit tagging` for processing parameters. This **may break** your code if you 
expect combined handling of query/path/form params.
Please see the updated documentation for [request](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/request) and [binding](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/request)

The handling for rewrite rules has been slightly adjusted to expand `*` to a non-greedy `(.*?)` capture group. This is only relevant if multiple asterisks are used in your rules.
Please see [rewrite](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/rewrite) and [proxy](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/proxy) for details.

# Changelog

## v4.2.0 - 2020-02-11

**Important notes**

The behaviour for binding data has been reworked for compatibility with echo before v4.1.11 by
enforcing `explicit tagging` for processing parameters. This **may break** your code if you 
expect combined handling of query/path/form params.
Please see the updated documentation for [request](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/request) and [binding](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/request)

The handling for rewrite rules has been slightly adjusted to expand `*` to a non-greedy `(.*?)` capture group. This is only relevant if multiple asterisks are used in your rules.
Please see [rewrite](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/rewrite) and [proxy](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware/proxy) for details.

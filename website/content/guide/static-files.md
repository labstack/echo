## Using `Echo#Static()`

`Echo#Static(prefix, root string)` registers a new route with path prefix to serve
static files from the provided root directory.

*Usage 1*

```go
e := echo.New()
e.Static("/static", "assets")
```

Example above will serve any file from the assets directory for path `/static/*`. For example,
a request to `/static/js/main.js` will fetch and serve `assets/js/main.js` file.

*Usage 2*

```go
e := echo.New()
e.Static("/", "assets")
```

Example above will serve any file from the assets directory for path `/*`. For example,
a request to `/js/main.js` will fetch and serve `assets/js/main.js` file.

## Using `Echo#File()`

`Echo#File(path, file string)` registers a new route with path to serve a static
file.

*Usage 1*

Serving an index page from `public/index.html`

```go
e.File("/", "public/index.html")
```

*Usage 2*

Serving a favicon from `images/favicon.ico`

```go
e.File("/favicon.ico", "images/favicon.ico")
```
